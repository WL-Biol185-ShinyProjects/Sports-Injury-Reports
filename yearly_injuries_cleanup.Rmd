knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

yearly_injuries cleanup
- removing extra headers and footnotes
- deleting extra space between each year
- remove participant column and percent concussion related column (because not all years have these columns)
- shifted all columns to fill gaps from deleted columns
- added year column
- removing column titles between years
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
